# restaurant-ordering-app

A restaurant ordering app with Vue, Vue router, Vuex, babel, Firebase

> A Vue.js project

Have you ever having to wait for someone to take your order?
Especially in busy restaurants?
What about keeping the waiter/waitress waiting to take your order because you just can't decide on your order?
Sometimes wait staff are deployed to other tasks such as bringing out dishes for a large group, and no one is available to take orders, and at the same time kitchen staff are waiting for orders?
Hungry customers frustrated because the neighboring table is taking forever to order?
Take away customers queuing for their orders to be taken?

Well, this app should solve all these problems and free up restaurant wait staff so they can serve the customer better and more efficiently.

Restaurants saves cost for having more effient staff and customers are much happier knowing that their requests will be responded to promptly.
